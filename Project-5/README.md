## Contact App
- Added functionality to add, update and delete the contacts through db and update UI accordingly.
- Used the `Firebase` database for these operations.
- Added support to open modal to add/update the contact.
- Created form using `Formik` and error handled using the `Yup` since Formik supports it.
- Added support to show the correct toast message.
